# C45 Introduction

C4.5 is an algorithm used to generate a decision tree developed by Ross Quinlan. C4.5 is an extension of Quinlan's
earlier ID3 algorithm. The decision trees generated by C4.5 can be used for classification, and for this reason, C4.5 is
often referred to as a statistical classifier. In 2011, authors of the Weka machine learning software described the C4.5
algorithm as "a landmark decision tree program that is probably the machine learning workhorse most widely used in
practice to date".
