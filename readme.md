# Data Science

This a repository for my data science courses.
I will add all the codes and notes here following my studies.

At first, I will write some basic python and R codes, and relevant packages for data analysis and data visualization.
Then I will move to popular artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
Finally, I will focus on cut-edged multiple modal algorithms, integrated by language, images, sounds and more.
